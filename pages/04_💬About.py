The ‘Seven c Pirate Crew’ is a collective for all things pirate…

Want to be an on chain pirate? The ‘Seven c’ collection was launched with ‘Pixel Pirates’ and now continues with ‘Pirate Life'. Both FNFTs contain cLQDR, an auto-compounding liquid version of Liquid Driver's xLQDR. 🤑

Treasure hunts will continue and new pirate gems will be unearthed. Are you an on chain pirate? If so come and join the Pirate Crew! 🏴‍☠️

## Why this Tracker?
This was created by me aka 🍓ALMIGHTY ABE🍓 to help Seven c Pirate Crew holders to view their collection, check out the various attributes they hold, follow sales on Secondary, and more.

## Note
This web app is in beta.

The scores calculated are not official, I am not responsible for any losses incurred due to the same.

The rarity scores is roughly calculated as follows:
[Rarity Score for a Trait Value] = 1 / ([Number of Items with that Trait Value] / [Total Number of Items in Collection])

Additionally a bonus score is given to PPs that were 1/1s and specials.
