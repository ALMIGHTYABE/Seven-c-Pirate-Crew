Pixel Pirates (PPs) are the brainchild of the legendary Hoeem. Together with the expertise of Hedgey Finance, Hoeem brought to life a wildly popular project with a large supporting community. 🤺

Simply put it is a generative art collection of pirates all of which live on the blockchain all with 1 cLQDR inside; as cLQDR auto-compounds and tracks the price of LQDR these NFTs have a base floor attached to how we value them. The NFT can be burnt through Hedgey.finance to accrue to the underlying token it is backed by. 💰

Along with that, there are also various giveaways and competitions that are running where your Pixel Pirate traits are needed to compete in! 😛

The Pirate Community are always looking for new crew mates on board, they usually hang out in both the LiquidDriver Discord “NFT-Lounge” and in the Hedgey Finance discord! Come say hello if you have any questions to ask them! 😉 

## Why this Tracker?
This was created by me aka 🍓ALMIGHTY ABE🍓 to help Seven c Pirate Crew holders to view their collection, check out the various attributes they hold, follow sales on Secondary, and more.

## Note
This web app is in beta.

The scores calculated are not official, I am not responsible for any losses incurred due to the same.

The rarity scores is roughly calculated as follows:
[Rarity Score for a Trait Value] = 1 / ([Number of Items with that Trait Value] / [Total Number of Items in Collection])

Additionally a bonus score is given to PPs that were 1/1s and specials.
